# Sentiment Analysis on Flipkart Product Reviews

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to classify customer reviews on Flipkart as **positive** or **negative**. It demonstrates the use of **TF-IDF vectorization**, **Logistic Regression**, and **confusion matrix visualization** for sentiment prediction.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- Source: [Flipkart Product Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hrithiqgupta/flipkart-product-reviews-for-sentient-analysis)
- Features: `ProductName`, `Price`, `Rate`, `Review`, `Summary`
- Target: `Rate` (converted to Sentiment: 1 = Positive, 0 = Negative)

---

## ðŸ”§ Techniques Used 

- Text Preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopwords)
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression (for binary classification)
- Train-Test Split with Stratification
- Evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix (Seaborn heatmap)
